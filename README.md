# Linktree Clone

This project is an application similar to Linktree, developed for the Front-End discipline. It allows users to access a custom link page by entering an ID in the URL.

## Technologies Used
* TypeScript
* Vite

## How It Works
1. The user enters an ID in the URL ```http://localhost:5173/?id:id```
2. The application reads the data corresponding to the ID from a JSON file.
3. The page is dynamically rendered with the links associated with the provided ID.
